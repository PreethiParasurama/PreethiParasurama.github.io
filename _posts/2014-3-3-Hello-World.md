title: 10 days in Alaska: The Perfect Itinerary!

##Day 1: Our Coffee shop hunt:
K and I landed in Anchorage, AK in an early September afternoon, rented a car and headed straight to Denali National Park, which is a 4-5 hour drive from Anchorage. Because of numerous flight delays and cancellations, we were sleep deprived and decided to grab a coffee for the long drive ahead. At this point, we were already 2 hours into our drive. When I opened the google maps to find the nearest Starbucks, well, guess what, only 100 miles away is the first coffee place found. Welcome to Alaska!
